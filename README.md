# iOS Crash After API Data Fetch in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native application crashes on iOS after fetching data from a remote API. The Android version of the app works without issue.

## Bug Description

A React Native app crashes on iOS after successfully fetching data from a remote API. The error occurs after the `response.json()` method call in the `useEffect` hook. The Android version of the same app works without any problems. The error is not consistently reproducible on iOS simulators and devices, making debugging challenging. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure that the response body is not null or undefined before parsing it as JSON and handling potential errors more robustly.
